  <h1> About Me </h1>

  <div id="myself">
    <p>Hi everyone my name is Philippe,
      I'm originally from Haiti move here about 7 years ago. I've been in the IT field for over 10 years now.
      So it all started as a project I wanted to build a personal home server that I saw at a friend and
      taught it was cool. Ever since I got really curious on how a server work, how to manage it.
      I started with online documentation and asking questions to the back end web developers at work any time
      I wanted to do or fix something. I got more and more curious so here in my journey of hopefully becoming
      a back end developer myself. I have a good background in Java language still working on getting better.
      I’m married to a wonderful woman and from that came a wonderful girl. I bike, sail a lot and a little
      swimming typical habit of an island man. I’m and avid lover of scotch, beer and all type of cuisine.
      I love music and listen to all genre but my favorite are Kompa (Haitian music genre), Jazz, afro-Cuban jazz
      and House music. And I’m very excited about this class thank you already to Prof Buck and all the TA’s
      for the knowledge that I hope to extract from your brains. Not sure if I said the last line right but you
      get the idea.</p>
